```

## Problem 1 

```{r}
## A random sample of size 10 from a uniform [0,5] distribution
x = runif(10, min = 0, max = 5)
x
  
## A logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater than 2
x > 2

## A (length-10) character vector
food <- c("I", "am", "very", "hungry", "would", "you", "like", "to", "go", "eat")

## A (length-10) factor vector
size <- c("Small", "Large", "Medium", "Medium", "Medium", "Large", "Small", "Large", "Large", "Medium")

homework_df = tibble(
  vec_char = c("I", "am", "very", "hungry", "would", "you", "like", "to", "go", "eat"),
  vec_logical = c(x > 2),
  vec_factor = factor(c("Small", "Large", "Medium", "Medium", "Medium", "Large", "Small", "Large", "Large", "Medium"))
)
```

```{r}
## Mean of logical vector 
mean(x>2)

## Mean of character vector
mean(food)

## Mean of factor vector
mean(size)

## Out of the 3 variables, only the logical vector was able to produce a mean (0.6).It did not work for character and factor vector because both are not in numerics.  
```

```{r}
## Applying as.numeric function to logical, character, and factor variables
as.numeric(as.factor(size))

as.numeric(as.character(food))

as.numeric(as.logical(x>2))
```

```{r}
## Converting character variable from character to factor to numeric
as.numeric(as.factor(food))

## Converting factor variable from factor to character to numeric
as.numeric(as.character(size))

## It was not possible to convert the factor variable from factor to character to numeric.
```

## Problem 2

## `Plotting and the use of inline R code`
```{r}
plot_df = tibble(
  x = rnorm(1000),
  y = rnorm(1000),
  x + y > 0,
  as.numeric(as.logical(x + y > 0)),
  as.factor(as.logical(x + y > 0))
)
```

The size of the data set is `r nrow(plot_df)` rows and `r ncol(plot_df)` columns.
The mean is `r mean(x)`.

```{r}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point(aes(color = x + y > 0))
```

```{r}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point(aes(color = as.numeric(as.logical(x + y > 0))))
```

```{r}
ggplot(plot_df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point(aes(color = as.numeric(as.logical(x + y > 0))))
```
